Rosmo is a project to make small openhardware robots for educational and hobbyist use. We aim to design capable robots which can be assembled without soldering. It's a modular set of open-hardware components that can be assembled into robots of different complexity and price. 

## XRP-X4
A small PCB based robot based on the circuit board from [Experiential robotics Platform.](https://experientialrobotics.org/)
